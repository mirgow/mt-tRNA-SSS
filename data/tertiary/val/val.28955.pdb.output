 System will be given a buffer of (in A):

 All-Atom  graining will be used
 checked pdb file.  All atoms were recognized.
 PDB file read in
 NOTE: This webtool only uses coordinate precision to 10^-2 A

 GENERIC WARNING:  You are including DNA and/or RNA.
 Make sure your PDB file includes a D in front of   
 residue names of DNA nucleic acids (DA,DG,DC,DT)   
 and that RNA nucleic acids do not (i.e. A,C,G,U)   
 If you did not, then you are about to receive many 
 more messages regarding missing atoms...
